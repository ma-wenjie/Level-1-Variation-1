  <title><b>A SIGHT IN CAMP</b></title>
  <p>
  A Sight in camp in the day-break grey and dim,
As from my tent I emerge so early, sleepless,
As slow I walk in the cool fresh air, the path near by the hospital 
     tent,
Three forms I see on stretchers lying, brought out there, untended 
     lying,
Over each the blanket spread, ample brownish woollen blanket,
Grey and heavy blanket, folding, covering all.

Curious, I halt, and silent stand;
Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest, the first, 
     just lift the blanket:
Who are you, elderly man so gaunt and grim, with well-grey'd hair, 
     and flesh all sunken about the eyes?
Who are you, my dear comrade?

Then to the second I step--And who are you, my child and darling?
Who are you, sweet boy, with cheeks yet blooming?

Then to the third--a face nor child, nor old, very calm, as of 
     beautiful yellow-white ivory;
Young man, I think I know you--I think this face of yours is the face 
     of the Christ himself;
Dead and divine, and brother of all, and here again he lies.
